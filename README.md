# ABSTRACT

This study developed and optimized HAPI BOT (Hydro Automotive Plant Irrigation), an automated plant irrigation robot, to address the impact of heat stress and inefficient watering on plant growth. The robot aims to accurately detect and measure soil moisture levels, effectively activate irrigation based on these conditions, and ensure a balanced watering process. The HAPI BOT utilizes a soil moisture sensor, microcontroller, and water pump to automate plant irrigation. Testing in a controlled greenhouse environment demonstrated the robot's ability to accurately detect dry soil conditions (below 85% moisture), activate the water pump system, and cease irrigation upon reaching optimal moisture levels (90%). The HAPI BOT offers a practical solution for efficient and sustainable plant care, particularly in school greenhouses and urban gardening settings. This study promotes hands-on learning in robotics and sustainable agriculture, contributing to a more efficient and environmentally conscious approach to plant cultivation.

Additionally, the design of the HAPI BOT uses a Hydro modular approach, which makes maintenance simple and allows for flexibility in accommodating different plant species and growing conditions. The system's ability to adapt in real time was demonstrated by an evaluation of its reactivity to changing environmental factors, including temperature and humidity. When compared to manual irrigation techniques, data analysis showed a considerable decrease in water waste. The automated aspect of the robot reduces human error and work, enabling accurate and reliable watering schedules. Its usability is improved by the incorporation of an intuitive interface that makes it simple to monitor and modify irrigation parameters. The study emphasizes how robotics can be used to solve problems in agriculture, increase resource efficiency, and help students and gardeners gain a better understanding of plant physiology.
